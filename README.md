# numba reduced neuoronal models
Single neuronal models encoded in python language numba speed up.
Note model waveforms are returned in Neo Format, converting between array to neo might introduce a sometimes tolerable overhead.


A slowly Expanding model Zoo. 

# TODO 
* add MAT neuron models
* add Neo variable time step AnalogSignal
