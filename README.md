# numba reduced neuoronal models
Single neuronal models encoded in python language numba speed up.
Note model waveforms are returned in Neo Format, converting between array to neo might introduce a sometimes tolerable overhead.

Models:
* Adaptive Exponential.
* Izhikevich 2007 (not 2003).
* Multi Time Scale Adaptive Neuron
